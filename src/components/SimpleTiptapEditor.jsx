Terms and conditions of employment </strong></p><p>This Employment Agreement (""<strong>Agreement</strong>"") is an integral part to this letter and sets the terms and conditions of your employment with us. It constitutes your principal statement of employment particulars as required by employment law. </p><p><strong>2. Your employer and start date</strong></p><p>We are your Employer and the start date are set out above and shall be the start of your continuous employment with us. No employment with any previous employer or period during which you provided consulting services count as part of your period of continuous employment with us.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Job title and duties</strong></p><p>3.1. &nbsp;Your job title is set out at the beginning of this letter. You will faithfully and diligently carry out
    all of the duties set out above, any other tasks and duties normally associated with this role and,
    such other duties which we may reasonably require of you from time to time, to the best of
    your ability. You must be prepared to be flexible in this regard. You will use your best
    endeavours to promote, protect, develop and extend our interests and our business.
    </p><p>


                  3.2. &nbsp;Subject to any agreement between the parties to the contrary, during your employment, you
    shall devote the whole of your time, attention and ability to our business.
    </p><p>


                  3.3. &nbsp;You shall comply with our rules, regulations and policies at all times. A copy of these will be
    made available to you and we may, amend, augment or revoke them at any time. We may do
    this by issuing new versions of those documents or by separate policies. None of our rules,
    policies or procedures give you any contractual rights. It is, however, a condition of your
    employment that you comply with the rules, policies and procedures which we establish. Failure to observe and comply with these can lead to disciplinary action being taken and may, in serious cases, lead to dismissal.</p><p><strong>4. Other employment</strong></p><p>4.1. You must devote the whole of your time, attention andability during your working hours to us. You may not, under any circumstances, undertake any other duties of any kind and whether or not remunerated, during your hours of work for us. </p><p>4.2. &nbsp;During your employment you will not be employed, engaged, interested or concerned in any office or outside business interests (whether paid or unpaid) without our written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any paid or unpaid consulting services for any company besides us. </p><p>4.3. &nbsp;You will disclose to us in writing any such offices or outside business interests you may currently have and in the event that we require you to ceasethe same, you will do so forthwith. For the avoidance of doubt consent will not be given in relation to any activities, offices or business interests which, in our view, are similar to or compete directly or indirectly with our business, or which could, in our view, give rise to a conflict of interest or interfere with the efficient performance of your duties. <br></p><p><strong>5. Place and hours of work </strong></p><p>5.1. &nbsp;The place of work shall be our offices or any other place within the United Kingdom which we may reasonably require you to work from for the proper performance and exercise of your duties, subject to any remote working policies or agreements with your line manager in place from time to time. <br></p><p>5.2. &nbsp;Your normal working hours are between { insert working hours}., {insert working days}}(inclusive), with a one-hour lunch break. Due to the nature of our business, flexibility of working hours is paramount. You will therefore be expected to work such additional hours as the needs of the business dictate, without additional pay unless otherwise agreed with us. Regulation 4(1) of the Working Time Regulations 1998 (the ""WTR"") provides that a worker's average working time, including overtime, should not exceed 48 hours for each seven-day period (to be averaged overa period of 17 weeks) unless the worker agrees otherwise.

You may at any time give three months' written notice to withdraw your agreement to this. <br></p><p>5.3. &nbsp;Depending on the nature of yourresponsibilities, we may reasonably require you to travel within the UK as well as overseas for the proper fulfilment of your duties, and you agree to do so.

We may review your salary from time to time but we make no commitment to increase your salary on review. Any salary rise will be at our sole discretion and will not affect any other terms of your employment. Any increase in salary will not confer any contractual right to future increases. We will not review your salary after notice has been given by either party to terminate your employment. <br></p><p>6.2. &nbsp;Further details on these benefits are available to you from your line manager. We may replace, augment or withdraw such benefits, or amend the terms of such benefits, at any time on reasonable notice to you. <br></p><p><strong>7.

We may also require a medical certificate from your doctor and/or any doctor(s) nominated by us, confirming that you are fit to return to work after any period of absence. We have the right to postpone your return to work (and the continuance or reinstatement of your normal pay, if appropriate) until our nominated doctor(s) has confirmed you are fit to return. <br></p><p>12.4. &nbsp;We reserve the right at any time (whether or not he is incapacitated) to require you to undergo medical examinations at our expense with our nominated doctor.

Any Employer sick pay paid to you will be inclusive of any SSP payable. The agreed SSP’s ‘qualifying days’ are Monday to Friday. <br></p><p>12.6. &nbsp;Failure to comply with any of these procedures or any policy relating to sickness absence that may be in place from time to time may result in disciplinary action and the withholding of sick pay. <br></p><p>12.7. &nbsp;In the event of you sustaining an injury caused by a third party from whom you would be entitled torecover damages in respect of the loss of Salary, we reserve the right to claim a refund of any Employer sick pay made to you under this clause during absence due to such injury and any payments made in such event shall be regarded as a loan repayable by you upon the receipt of such damages. </p><p><strong>13.
